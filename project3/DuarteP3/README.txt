The purpose of if (rect != thisRect) SetUp(rect) is to actually set up the grid proportions.

The different parameters passed into TransparentBlt are the x destination, y destination, destination width, destination height, something, x source, y source, source width, source height, and the copy.

A message box is a box that appears with a message.

You might want to use the OnKeyDown function when you want to use another key such as 'u' for update grid. You can also use the key 'r' to restart the game.

State allows us to move to the next to call each function individually with a second delay so you can see everything happening instead of updating really quick without showing the user.

The call to update grid in case 4 will make it so if you want to cascade tiles.

Everything is done for the project.
The things is did for extra credit are sound when there is a match of 3 or more, implemented keys i, r, n, and e, and lastly implemented an exit button.
