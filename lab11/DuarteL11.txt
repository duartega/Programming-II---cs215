Question 1, Step 7: My prediction is that it is going to add the strings and the print them, then print them backwards. 

Question 2, Step 8: Yes the output is what I expected. The out put is the same because we have already reversed them and the print list calls print node which prints the same thing.

Question 3, Step 9: It is the bitwise AND operator.

Part 2
Question 4, Step 20: It outputs the list but on seperate lines.

Question 5, Step 21: It outputs the reversed list on seperate lines.
